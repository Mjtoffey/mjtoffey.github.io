## Learning the basics ##

This week has been quite the adjustment for me.  While I love working with computers, I come from a career field that has very little to do with the hidden workings of the web and have had to take extra care that I am understanding all of the concepts taught to us at the **Awesome Inc.** bootcamp.    I have been lucky enough to connect with people at this bootcamp that have been a **huge help** in starting my jounrey as a Developer.

 Due to my lack of experience in the field I didn't have much idea of what to expect.  *Obviously* I knew we would be working on the basics of coding, however the challenges I faced in setting up the work space were a little unexpected. Although my experience with HTML and CSS are limited, I am able to understand the goal of the language and the purpose behind the syntax, it is just a matter of taking the time and working on the repitions, as well as putting myself in uncomfortable positions to learn more about them.  Git, GitHub, GitPod and the CLI are a different story altogether.  I had done some work in VSCode in the past, however syncing that to the GitPod space proved challenging.  My biggest hurdle was understanding the syntax and applying that to the repositories I was working on.
 
 Despite my challenges I am eager to learn more about how these spaces interact and how I can leverage their design to assist me in the future.  The thing I am most excited for is learning how to dress up a web page in my own individual style and truly make something that I can call *my own*.
 
 I hope this blog will allow me to become more familiar these spaces and provide a space of reflection for me to discuss the knowledge I currently have, as well as set goals and track progress.

 # Week 2! #
 
 This week we dove head first into JavaScript and pseudocode, helping us take a deeper dive into what makes each webpage unique.  HTML and CSS were simple for me to grasp, although not fully understanding how to control both I still recognize that HTML is the basic structure of the webpage, allowing for the foundation of what will soon become the website.  CSS is quite simple, however has many layers allowing the user to style the page, from colors and fonts to layout and text behavior.  JavaScript however is a totally different beast.  JavaScript allows for the programmer to add funtionality and certain characteristics to a page that go far beyond just the style.  One of my classmates reffered to javaScript as the "wizard", making the page behave in ways that it could not otherwise.
 
 Part of the challenege of JavaScript comes from the manipulation of variables and using those to come up with the "magic" to be presented.  This is where pseudocode became integral.  Pseudocode to me matched that of a lesson plan, and as a former educator I relied heavily on the pseudocode process to help me organize my thoughts and simplify the variables before you begin to maipulate them.  While it may feel tedious, I think pseudocode is the perfect tool for me to leverage and stop myself from overthinking each challenege before I even begin.
 
 These past two weeks of onboarding have definitely been a wake up call for me.  While I knew this enviornment would be challenging, I think I underestimated the chasllenege when coming into the bootcamp.  Throughout the onboarding process I have to continue to adjust to the remote enviornement and push ymself to develop healthy home habits as well as make more of an effort to develop personal relationships with the people around me.  These refined daily habits and relationships have allowed me to adjust to the fast paced learning and challenge that is learning to code.  My biggest obstacle however will always remain myself.  This week I really had to go the extra mile to stay on task and remind myself that there is always more to learn.  I found my time management to be sloppy and my ability to take in the inforamtion and apply it to my situation to be lacking to say the least.  While I have not yet overcome either of these challeneges yet I know the path that I have to take to get there.  For time management I must limit any and all outside distraction for small periods so I can fully dive into into learning.  If I can work in blocks of 25 minutes of intense focus and 5 minutes of rest I will definitely begin to tackle assisgnments in better time and probably begin to retain more as well.
 
 While this plan of action may need some time and revisions I know that I have to continue to be critical of myself and be disciplined in my approach to the rest of this learning process.
